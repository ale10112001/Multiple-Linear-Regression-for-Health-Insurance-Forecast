# Multiple-Linear-Regression-for-Health-Insurance-Forecast
Data Analysis and Exploration (S&amp;DS 230) Final Project

As my final project for my Data Analysis and Exploration class (S&DS 230), I wrote a 9-page report using the R programming language and the RStudio IDE where I created a multiple linear regression model for health insurance forecast. I used a dataset called “Medical Cost Personal Datasets” which is freely available on Kaggle. In this project I looked at three explanatory variables: age, body mass index, and smoking.
